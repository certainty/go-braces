# Assorted notes for development

* Optimise representation of Instructions (take care of propper alignment in memory to increase cache efficiency)
* Optimize the VM side for performance (efficient resource usage)
* Optimize the compiler side for correctness (use types to  help)
* Add example tests
* Add godoc to the packages that have settled (use the documention in the introspection to link to useful information)
